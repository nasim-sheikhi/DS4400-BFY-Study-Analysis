The impact of poverty on child development is a key area of research that can be subdivided into various factors, including maternal stress levels and household income. This paper looks at the Baby’s First Years study, which examines poverty, maternal health, and child health throughout early development. The aim of our data analysis is to determine which socioeconomic and environmental factors can best predict child health and development. We used Decision Tree and Logistic Regression Classifiers and Multiple Regression to determine the effect of these aspects on poor or good child health outcomes at the age of one. The highest accuracy we achieved was 67.2% with 20 features and 66.8% with 36 features. These models were decently effective; however, our Multiple Regression model returned a low coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.20), pointing to high variability between variables. Therefore, we believe that with our set of selected features, this survey can be narrowed down so that more data can be obtained, which can be used to inform on risk factors that affect a child’s health and development.
